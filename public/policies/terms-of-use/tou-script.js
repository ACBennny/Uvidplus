                                    purchase Uvidplus Content (as defined below) through the Site or Services in a few
                                    different ways including: (i) Uvidplus Members can pay a monthly membership fee to view
                                    certain Uvidplus Content for the applicable time period ("Membership Fee"); or (ii)

                                    to a membership to view Uvidplus Content via a Membership Fee. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE
                                    AND THERE ARE NO PRORATED REFUNDS OF ANY FEES UPON ANY TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION. Fees are
                                    refundable in Uvidplus's sole discretion. You agree to immediately pay any amounts
                                    accrued, but remaining unpaid, as of termination (if any). You hereby authorize Uvidplus
                                    to collect fees by charging the credit card you provide to us as part of your Uvidplus
                                    account information, either directly or indirectly via a third party online payment service,

                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">Your access to Uvidplus Content may start with a
                                    free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for seven (7) days, or as
                                    otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may
                                    apply. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. Uvidplus reserves the
                                    right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">We will begin billing your Payment Method for
                                    monthly Membership Fee at the end of the free trial period of your membership unless you
                                    cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your
                                    membership, including the monthly Membership Fee, visit the Site and click on the "Your
                                    Account" link available at the top of the pages of the Site. You will not receive a notice
                                    from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership
                                    has begun. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your
                                    membership fee until you cancel.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">By starting your Uvidplus membership and
                                    providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly
                                    Membership Fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection
                                    with your use of the Service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed
                                    each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due
                                    to promotional offers, including gift card redemption and promotional code redemption,
                                    and/or changing or adding a channel or bundle, and you authorize us to charge your Payment
                                    Method for such varying amounts, which will be billed monthly in one or more charges.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our
                                    service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our
                                    sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of
                                    Use, any price changes to your service will take effect in accordance with the time frame
                                    outlined in the email notice to you.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">The Membership Fee for the Service will be billed at
                                    the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and
                                    until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on
                                    the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. We reserve the
                                    right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your
                                    Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a
                                    day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the
                                    applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your
                                    Uvidplus membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is
                                    likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your
                                    renewal date may change due to changes in your membership. As used in these Terms of Use,
                                    "bill" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against
                                    your Payment Method.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">You may edit your Payment Method information by
                                    visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link, available at the top of the
                                    pages of the Site. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient
                                    funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your
                                    account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and
                                    authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result
                                    in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your
                                    Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your
                                    Payment Method service provider for details.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">You may cancel your Uvidplus membership at any
                                    time, and you will continue to have access to the Site and/or Services through the end of
                                    your monthly billing period. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically
                                    close at the end of your current billing period.&nbsp.

                                    effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Initial Dispute Resolution Section, and
                                    only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration using the
                                    procedures set forth below (subject to the exceptions in Section 14(e) and the terms set
                                    forth below), as the sole means to resolve claims. To initiate an arbitration, subject to
                                    the requirements described in this Section, you or Uvidplus must file a demand for
                                    arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”). After filing a copy of the
                                    demand with NAM, you must also email a copy to acuvidtemp@gmail.com. Merely emailing a
                                    demand to Uvidplus will not commence an arbitration proceeding. If Uvidplus is
                                    initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated
                                    with your Uvidplus account. You and Uvidplus agree that all Disputes shall be resolved
                                    exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 14 (the “Arbitration
                                    Agreement”). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring
                                    before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement (or any prior agreement) as well as
                                    claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration
                                    Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") in all respects and evidences a
                                    transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Uvidplus expressly agree that the FAA
                                    shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

                                    NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location
                                    where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with
                                    Uvidplus and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other
                                    similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of
                                    combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties
                                    further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to
                                    establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator
                                    believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the
                                    parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching
                                    shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration”
                                    provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to
                                    trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and
                                    Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Uvidplus otherwise
                                    consents in writing, Uvidplus does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private
                                    attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under
                                    any circumstances, except as set forth in this Section 14(f) (“Batch Arbitration”). If your
                                    demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until
                                    your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">The parties agree that this Batch Arbitration
                                    provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing.
                                    If the Batch Arbitration provision in this Section 14(f) is found to be invalid,
                                    unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and
                                    void, and neither you nor Uvidplus shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a
                                    part of the Mass Filing.</p>
                                <p class="tou-sect-ctnt-text">The results of the first batch of demands will be
                                    given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators, with
                                    Uvidplus and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and
                                    then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being
                                    selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands
                                    in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Uvidplus, the
                                    mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on
                                    a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are
                                    unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period and cannot agree on a
                                    methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Uvidplus or any
                                    remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in
                                    court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the
                                    Mediation Period. If neither Uvidplus nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot
                                    agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the
                                    arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Opt out of arbitration under this
                                    section shall not be construed as opt out of Section 14(d), “Class Action Waiver.” Absent
                                    notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the
                                    sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.</p>
