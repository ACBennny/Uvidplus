Important Update:
I recently became aware of a user named Adhaaz Daa (github.com/Adhaaz) who copied my repository as his own. I also saw another user forking from this repository. I would like to mention that I am not affiliated with this account and have blocked this user to prevent further interactions with my repo. 
Along with this action, I have made some other important changes:

1. The demo site has been changed to uvid-acbennny.netlify.app
2. The repository name has been changed to Uvid-acbennny
3. The repository is now private.
4. I have also included a link to my Github page so viewers can easily identify the author

Although I cannot do anything about the code he has copied into his, I believe these changes will aid in further preventing scenarios like this. 
I sincerely apologize for any inconveniences caused.
